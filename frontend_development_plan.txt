===============================================
Django + HTMX Mobile First Frontend Development Plan
===============================================

Goal: Create a dedicated frontend for Django administration to build a full-stack mobile application with Django as backend and HTMX for dynamic frontend interactions.

Version: 2.0
Date: February 2026

---

1. Project Overview
===================

This plan outlines the development of a mobile-first frontend for a Django-based attendance management system. The frontend will leverage HTMX for dynamic updates without writing JavaScript, providing a seamless user experience for both lecturers and students.

2. Technology Stack
===================

- **Backend**: Django 5.0
- **Frontend Framework**: Django Templates + HTMX 1.x + Alpine.js (lightweight JS)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 3.x
- **Icons**: Font Awesome 6.x
- **JavaScript Helpers**: Vanilla JS, Hyperscript
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)
- **Authentication**: Django Auth System with custom backends
- **API**: Django REST Framework (for mobile app integration)
- **Mobile App**: React Native / Flutter / Expo (planned)

3. Project Structure
====================

10. Key HTMX Patterns
======================

### 10.1 Form Submission

    <!-- form fields -->
</form>
```

### 10.2 Inline Editing
```html
<td hx-get="{% url 'edit_lecturer' lecturer.id %}" hx-target="this" hx-swap="outerHTML">
    {{ lecturer.name }}
</td>
```

### 10.3 Search with Debounce
```html
<input type="text" name="q" hx-get="{% url 'search_students' %}" 
       hx-trigger="keyup changed delay:500ms" hx-target="#student-list">
```

### 10.4 Confirmation Dialogs
```html
<button hx-delete="{% url 'delete_course' course.id %}" 
        hx-confirm="Are you sure you want to delete this course?">
    Delete
</button>
```

### 10.5 Loading States
```html
<div hx-get="{% url 'dashboard_stats' %}" hx-trigger="load">
    <span class="htmx-indicator">Loading...</span>
